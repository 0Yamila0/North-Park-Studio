# North-Park-Studio

Northpark Studio of the Arts is a local studio for teaching kids about the fine arts. The owner of the establishment, Mrs. Deborah, founded the studio in 2018 and teaches lessons there along with other teachers. She was more than happy to let us build a website for her, even though she already has one, and provided us with media and information. This website was built by Yamila Diaz, Janaki Patel, and Sarah Daniels. We attend Madison Academic Magnet high school. We built our website for parents to find a warm and welcoming place for their child to learn about fine arts.

Our website:  
<br>
<ul>
  <li>We added parallax to every page except the home page. It makes the header animate to an extent and makes it a bit more interesting to look at.</li>
  <li>It is easy to navigate with obvious call to actions. The navbar is at the top and there are links throughout the website to take you to other pages to view certain content or sign up. The links also stand out from the page and tell you what to do</li>
  <li>We explain all information thoroughly and have the option to find more information if there are any more questions.</li>
  <li>The website has plenty of information to inform parents about the establishment.</li>
  <li>The website is responsive for all screen sizes and all images load properly.</li>
</ul>
