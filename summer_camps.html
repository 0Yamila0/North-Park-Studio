          <p class="sccontent"> The owner of Northpark Studio, Mrs.
            Deborah, grew up in Jackson, TN. Her dad was a preacher and her mom
            played the piano, but she learned from her piano teachers, and took
            voice lessons. She loved the classes and they were the highlight of
            her day. In college, she discovered her loved for theatre and managed
            to get her degree in English communications with a lot of theatre,
            piano, and voice classes. Once she got married, she did not quit her
            dreams of the arts. She began to teach a couple kids piano and voice
            lessons. </p>
        </div>
        <img class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 theory" src="s_twogirls.jpg">
        <br>
        <p class="col-md-12 col-lg-4 sccontent"> When she and her husband moved to Little
          Rock, Arkansas she opened a studio there which grew to contain 118
          students. She had the idea of opening that studio when she taught at
          a private school in Little Rock. She opened this studio in July 18,
          2018 once she got her business license. The studio first started with
          only 17 kids, but the studio has grown like crazy! And now there are
          59 students are participating in the classes. She wants this studio
          to grow and become a loving community for the arts. “I hope all of
          you find things to do with your lives that you can enjoy as much as
          I enjoy this, cause it’s pretty cool.” </p>
